Allows you to set product referral rates on a per-affiliate level in AffiliateWP.

== Description ==

> This plugin requires [AffiliateWP](http://affiliatewp.com/ "AffiliateWP") v1.5.2+ in order to function.

At its most basic level AffiliateWP allows you to set a global referral rate which all affiliates share. For integrations that support per-product referral rates, affiliates can earn different commissions based on which product/s are purchased. AffiliateWP also allows you to set referral rates on a per-affiliate level which will override any per-product referral rate.

Affiliate Product Rates expands this even further, allowing different per-product referral rates on a per-affiliate level.

Here are some examples of how you might use this plugin:

1. Give Affiliate X 10% commission for Product A, 80% commission for Product B, and a flat rate of $50 for Product C.
2. Give Affiliate Y 50% commission for Product A, but a lower commission than Affiliate X for Products B and C.
3. Give Affiliate Z a flat-rate of $10 commission for Product A, 65% commission for Product B and 22% commission for Product C.

The possibilities are endless! You can also set per-product referral rates per-affiliate per-integration! (for those that happen to be running both integrations listed below).

**Currently Supported Integrations**

1. Easy Digital Downloads
2. WooCommerce

**Known Issues**

The add-on doesn’t yet prevent a product from existing in more than 1 product rate. Be careful you don’t accidentally add a product to more than location or one rate will be ignored.
