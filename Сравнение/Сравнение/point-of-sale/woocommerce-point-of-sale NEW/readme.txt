Extend your online WooCommerce store by adding a 'brick and mortar' Point of Sale (POS) interface.

== Description ==

WooCommerce Point of Sale is an extension which allows you to place orders through a Point of Sale interface swiftly using the WooCommerce products and orders database. This extension is most suitable for retailers who have both an online and offline store.

= Synchronised Stock =
With this plugin, you do not need to re-add the products to a POS database as it automatically fetches the products from your existing WooCommerce products inventory. This includes variable products with individual stock quantities.

= Add Customers =
You can easily add customers or use the guest checkout when placing orders for your walk-in customers. The fields loaded when processing a customer is identical to the fields loaded at the checkout page on the web shop.

= Payment Options =
Use your existing payment gateway or accept cash with our amount tendered feature giving you quick calculations on discounts, change given and cash tendered.

= Card Scanning =
You can scan cards and have the payment details parsed automatically from the card scanner. You can check which gateways are compatible [here](http://actualityextensions.com/supported-payment-gateways/). If you want to check whether your existing card scanner works with this feature, please use our card scanner validator [here](http://demo.actualityextensions.com/card-swipe/).

= Product Grids =
Display your products in a grid for easier access to product catalogue. This works beautifully with variable products as well. You can also display a quantity keypad / toggle for efficient store management. The tiles in the grid can show product image, title and price.

= Status Management =
Manage the status of orders processed through the Point of Sale by choosing a status for complete orders, saved orders and what orders should appear when loading orders. You can also load web orders placed that are to be tendered in store.

= Integrations =
Our plugin is compatible with the following plugins:

1. [WooCommerce Checkout Field Editor](https://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-checkout-field-editor/)
2. [WooCommerce Address Validation](https://www.woothemes.com/products/postcodeaddress-validation/)

You can find the documentation to [here](http://actualityextensions.com/documentation/woocommerce-point-of-sale/). If there is anything missing from the documentation that you would like help on, please fill in our contact [form](http://actualityextensions.com/contact/).
